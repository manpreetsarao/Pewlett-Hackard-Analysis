# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
In the analysis, we created two tables, first is for number of employees retiring by its job title and second for mentorship table that tells us available employees in company for mentorship for new roles. To create these tables, we used our raw data tables with different information regarding companyâ€™s employees. We joined these tables by primary key constrains. 
The main purpose of this analysis is to verify that after retiring the employees does the company has enough senior employees to guide the company in right direction. 
## Results
-	From the figure, we can see that there are 25916 Senior Engineers eligible for retirement. It is a huge number.
-	There are two only two managers eligible for retirement which is good thing for company.
-	But overall, there are huge number of employees that are eligible for retirement. 
-	From the mentorship eligibility table, we can see we have a smaller number of employees than the total of eligible retirement table. So, the company need to work on the ratio that how many employees can be assigned for mentorship for a particular department.

## Summary
-	From results we can see that there are huge number of employees that are eligible for retirement, so company needs to fill all the positions which is more than 70 thousand.
-	From mentorship eligibility table we see that company does not have enough employees to add to mentorship program to fill all the senior positions.
### Suggestions
-	We can create a table to check the number of vacancies to be filled per department, and that could suggest the company to hire more employees in those departments in  next 3 years.
-	We can create another table to check for younger employees who have the potential to fill senior positions through mentorship program.
